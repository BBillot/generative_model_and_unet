function [cross]=checkCrossings(AxonsDistWithoutGap,BranchDistWithoutGap,threshold,newStart)

% Checks that the new branch doesn't cross existing axons.
% We are forced to consider the case where a branch starts from another
% branch. Obviously the new branch crosses its mother branch. So we
% tolerate crossings in the vicinity of the branching point. Otherwise (if
% crossing occurs far from the branching point), it probably
% means the new branch crosses another branch.
