% This script generates images imitating axons in chunks (N being the
% number of images in a chunk). It uses parameters contained
% in a JSON file. The images, corresponding segmentation maps (for both
% boutons and axons) as well as useful information are stored in a
% structure called data. Its fields are: the points that form the axons and
% their branches with or without gap, info about those points (to which
% axon and branch they belong) and gap sizes.

% The resulting images ('images.mat'), the axon segmentations
% ('axon_masks.mat') and the bouton segmentations ('bouton_masks.mat') are
% saved in separate files.

% Depending on size and the amount of data that one wishes to generate,
% Matlab might not be able to save the created matrices. That's why we can
% divide the images in several chunks that will be saved separately.
